Hi John, 

Thank you for reaching out to us about the current price of Bitcoin. Unfortunately, as the price of Bitcoin is constantly changing, I don't have the most up-to-date information to provide you. I recommend checking a reliable cryptocurrency website or exchange for the most current pricing information.

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
Sarah, Resident Manager
